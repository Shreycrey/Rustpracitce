This code in main.rs contains two functions, encrypt and decrypt, which work with a 16 byte plaintext string by converting it to a generic array and then encrytping/decrypting it. 

It also has three test cases to explore the testing capability of rust.

To execute, cd into the src folder and execute cargo build. After this, you either do cargo run to execute main or cargo test to execute test cases.
